# Effects-of-mass-on-terminal-velocity

During my IB Physics studies, I became intrigued by the concept of terminal velocity and its governing principles. I explored the relationship between mass and terminal velocity, discovering that the drag force acting on an object in free fall balances the gravitational force at this critical speed. My investigation focused on how varying the mass attached to a balloon influences its terminal velocity. Through experimental analysis, I sought to understand the practical implications of this relationship and validate the associated mathematical formulas.
